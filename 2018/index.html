            <p><b> <a href=" https://easychair.org/cfp/MLRec2018" target="blank"> CALL FOR PAPER</b></p>
		    
		    
	    <p>Following the success of the several editions of MLRec in
	      <a href="https://doogkong.github.io/2015/">2015</a>,
	      <a href="https://doogkong.github.io/2016/">2016</a>,
              <a href="https://doogkong.github.io/2017/">2017</a>,   
	      the fourth edition of the MLRec workshop focuses on developing novel, and applying existing
	      Machine Learning (ML) and Data Mining (DM) methods to improve recommender systems.
	      This workshop also highly encourages applying ML-based recommendation
	      algorithms in novel application domains (e.g., precision medicine), deep learning for recommendation, and 
	      solving novel recommendation problems formulated from industry.   
	      
	      
	      The ultimate goal of the MLRec workshop series is to promote the advancement and implementation of
	      new, effective and efficient ML and DM techniques with high translational potential
	      for real and large-scale recommender systems,
	      and to expand the territory of ML-based recommender system research toward non-conventional
	      application areas where recommendation problems largely exist but haven't been fully
	      recognized. 
	      <br>
	      <br>

								<b>Title:</b> Practical Recommender Systems: It's Not Just about Algorithms <br /> 
								<b>Abstract:</b>  
					   I will talk about approaches and experiences in building, deploying, testing and scaling recommender systems in commercial contexts. Recommender systems are used extensively in online shopping to campaign management to desktop software systems. While great use of data and clever algorithms that work are important, several aspects of scale, speed, product and revenue goals require one to look at other aspects of deploying such systems."
