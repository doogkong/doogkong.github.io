	      <h2>MLRec 2018</h2>
	      <p>4<sup>th</sup> International Workshop on Machine Learning Methods for Recommender Systems</p>
	    </header>
	    <p><b>In conjunction with <a href="http://www.siam.org/meetings/sdm18/" target="blank">18th SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM 2018)</a><br />
		May 3 - 5, 2018, San Diego, CA, USA</b></p>
	    
	    <p>Following the success of the several editions of MLRec in
	      <a href="https://doogkong.github.io/2015/">2015</a>,
	      <a href="https://doogkong.github.io/2016/">2016</a>,
              <a href="https://doogkong.github.io/2017/">2017</a>,   
	      the fourth edition of the MLRec workshop focuses on developing novel, and applying existing
	      Machine Learning (ML) and Data Mining (DM) methods to improve recommender systems.
	      This workshop also highly encourages applying ML-based recommendation
	      algorithms in novel application domains (e.g., precision medicine), deep learning for recommendation, and 
	      solving novel recommendation problems formulated from industry.   
	      
	      
	      The ultimate goal of the MLRec workshop series is to promote the advancement and implementation of
	      new, effective and efficient ML and DM techniques with high translational potential
	      for real and large-scale recommender systems,
	      and to expand the territory of ML-based recommender system research toward non-conventional
	      application areas where recommendation problems largely exist but haven't been fully
	      recognized. 
	      <br>
	      <br>
	    </p>

								<b>Julian McAuley</b>, University of California, San Diego <br /> 
								<b>Title:</b> TBA <br /> 
								<b>Abstract:</b> TBA  <br /> 
								<b>Bio: </b> Julian McAuley’s research focuses on the linguistic, temporal, and visual dimensions of opinions and behavior in social networks and online communities. This includes understanding the facets of people's opinions, the processes by which people "acquire tastes" for gourmet foods and beers, or even the visual dimensions that make clothing items compatible. He has been an assistant professor at UC San Diego since 2014, and received his PhD from the Australian National University. </p>
