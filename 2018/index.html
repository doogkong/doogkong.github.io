            <p><b> <a href=" https://easychair.org/cfp/MLRec2018" target="blank"> CALL FOR PAPER</b></p>
		    
		    
	    <p>Following the success of the several editions of MLRec in
	      <a href="https://doogkong.github.io/2015/">2015</a>,
	      <a href="https://doogkong.github.io/2016/">2016</a>,
              <a href="https://doogkong.github.io/2017/">2017</a>,   
	      the fourth edition of the MLRec workshop focuses on developing novel, and applying existing
	      Machine Learning (ML) and Data Mining (DM) methods to improve recommender systems.
	      This workshop also highly encourages applying ML-based recommendation
	      algorithms in novel application domains (e.g., precision medicine), deep learning for recommendation, and 
	      solving novel recommendation problems formulated from industry.   
	      
	      
	      The ultimate goal of the MLRec workshop series is to promote the advancement and implementation of
	      new, effective and efficient ML and DM techniques with high translational potential
	      for real and large-scale recommender systems,
	      and to expand the territory of ML-based recommender system research toward non-conventional
	      application areas where recommendation problems largely exist but haven't been fully
	      recognized.

								<b>Martin Ester</b>, Professor, Simon Fraser University <br /> 
								<b>Title:</b> Recommendation in Social Media <br /> 
								<b>Abstract:</b> Social media are media for social interaction, using highly accessible and
scalable communication techniques to create and exchange user-generated content. In
the social sciences, the effects of social influence, homophily or selection, and
transitivity have been identified as drivers of the dynamics of social networks. In the first
part of the talk we will present a matrix factorization approach to incorporate these
effects into a recommender system by regularizing the user factors with the user factors
of direct friends. In the second part, we will discuss how to exploit product reviews, a
popular type of user-generated content, to improve the accuracy of recommendations.
Our approach combines probabilistic matrix factorization with aspect-based opinion
mining, and we propose a graphical model based on latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) that
extracts product aspects and their ratings. Another important aspect of social media is
their support for user groups. In the third part of the talk, we explore the
recommendation of user groups. We propose measures for the different types of
engagement of users with groups that are more suitable than simple group
membership. We also introduce a temporal matrix factorization method that models the
dynamically changing patterns of user group engagement. The talk will conclude with
the discussion of interesting directions for future research. <br />

								<b>Julian McAuley</b>, Assistant Professor, University of California, San Diego <br /> 
								<b>Title:</b> Structured Output Models of Recommendations, Activities, and Behavior <br /> 
								<b>Abstract:</b> Predictive models of human behavior--and in particular recommender
systems--learn patterns from large volumes of historical activity data, in order to make
personalized predictions that adapt to the needs, nuances, and preferences of
individuals. Models may take incredibly complex data as *input*, ranging from text,
images, social networks, or sequence data. However, the *outputs* they are trained to
predict--clicks, purchases, transactions, etc.--are typically simple, numerical quantities,
in order for the problem to be cast in terms of traditional supervised learning
frameworks. In this talk, we discuss possible extensions to such personalized, predictive
models of human behavior so that they are capable of predicting complex structured
*outputs*. For example, rather than training a model to predict what content a user
might interact with, we could predict how they would react to unseen content, in the
form of text they might write. Or, rather than predicting whether a user would purchase
an existing product, we could predict the characteristics or attributes of the types of
products that *should* be created. <br /> 
								<b>Bio: </b> Julian McAuley’s research focuses on the linguistic, temporal, and visual dimensions of opinions and behavior in social networks and online communities. This includes understanding the facets of people's opinions, the processes by which people "acquire tastes" for gourmet foods and beers, or even the visual dimensions that make clothing items compatible. He has been an assistant professor at UC San Diego since 2014, and received his PhD from the Australian National University.

								<b>Neel Sundaresan</b>, Partner Director, Microsoft <br /> 
								<b>Title:</b> Practical Recommender Systems: It's Not Just about Algorithms <br /> 
								<b>Abstract:</b>  
I will talk about approaches and experiences in building, deploying, testing
and scaling recommender systems in commercial contexts. Recommender systems are
used extensively in online shopping to campaign management to desktop software
systems. While it is important to build lever data driven algorithms , several aspects of 
scale, cost, speed, product and revenue goals require one to look at other aspects of
deploying such systems. We will discuss real-life examples of such industrial
deployments.<br /> 
								<b>Bio: </b>  Dr. Neel Sundaresan is now a partner director at Microsoft. He is an entrepreneur
and advanced technologist with extensive experience in both the startup world and

								<b>Suju Rajan</b>,  VP, Head of Research at Criteo <br /> 
								<b>Title:</b> Modeling user intent for recommendation <br /> 
								<b>Abstract:</b> In this talk we will go over two case studies, one from personalization of the
newsfeed and another on product recommendation in a demand side platform. In both
cases, the intention is to provide personalized recommendations to the users but the
path to designing such systems is often not straight-forward and a lot of assumptions
are made on the way. Through the two applications, I hope to draw out and motivate
challenges that one faces in real-world large-scale recommendation and highlight some
attempts at solving these problems. <br />

								<b>Huzefa Rangwala</b>, Associate Professor,  George Mason University <br /> 
								<b>Title:</b> Recommender Systems in Educational Data Mining <br /> 
								<b>Abstract:</b>  The application of big data approaches, specifically methods inspired from
recommender system domain to predict student performance is largely a new area of
research. The types of solutions available depend largely on the type of available data,
and problem definition. For instance, for the purposes of degree planning, one task is to
predict grades for a student in a class in the future (or in the next term). In this talk, I will
present an overview of problems,
challenges and solutions for solving critical problems faced by higher education
institutions. <br />

								<b>Dawen Liang</b>, Research Scientist, NetFlix <br /> 
								<b>Title:</b> Beyond linear latent factor models for collaborative filtering <br /> 
								<b>Abstract:</b> Linear latent factor models still largely dominate the collaborative filtering
research literature due to their simplicity and effectiveness. Exploring more powerful
non-linear counterpart is an active research area. In this talk, I will outline two related
projects: First, I will show that by incorporating carefully designed non-linear features
into the classical matrix factorization model, we are able to significantly boost the
performance (RecSys'16); Second, I will talk about our recent work on extending
variational autoencoder, a non-linear probabilistic model, to collaborative filtering with
state-of-the-art results (WWW'18). <br />
