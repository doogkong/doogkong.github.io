      <p><strong>Description</strong><br/>
        The proposed workshop aims to bring the attention of researchers to the various data mining and machine learning methods for recommender systems. This is the third edition of the MLRec workshop. We had well-attended first two editions of the workshop with <a href="2015/index.html" target="blank">SDM 2015</a> and <a href="2016/index.html" target="blank">SDM 2016</a>.
      </p>

      <p>Since the inception of recommender systems, there have been a lot of machine learning and data mining algorithms designed for effective and efficient recommendation. To name a few, the matrix factorization techniques [1, 2, 3] are widely used to model the latent space in which users and items interact with each other. The factorization machine [4, 5] uses bilinear regression models [6, 7] to capture the non-linear interactions among the user features and item features. In the past years, researchers have utilized many machine learning techniques such as online learning, metric learning, sparse learning, multi-task learning also to foster the development of recommender systems.</p>

      <p>This workshop focuses on applying novel as well as existing machine learning and data mining methodologies for improving recommender systems. Indeed, there are many established conferences such as NIPS and ICML that focus on the study of theoretical properties of machine learning algorithms. On the other hand, the recent developed conference ACM RecSys focuses on different aspects of designing and implementing recommender systems. We believe that there is a gap between these two ends, and this workshop aims at bridging the recent advances of machine learning and data mining algorithms to improving recommender systems. Since many recommendation approaches are built upon data mining and machine learning algorithms, these approaches are deeply rooted in their foundations. As such, there is an urgent need for researchers from the two communities to jointly work on 1) what are the recent developed machine learning and data mining techniques that can be leveraged to address challenges in recommender systems, and 2) from challenges in recommender systems, what are the practical research directions in the machine learning and data mining community.</p>

      <p>We encourage submissions on a variety of topics, including but not limited to:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Novel machine learning algorithms for recommender systems, e.g., new content aware recommendation algorithms, new algorithms for matrix factorization handling cold-start items. </li>
        <li>Novel approaches for applying existing machine learning algorithms, e.g., applying bilinear models, sparse learning, metric learning, neural networks and deep learning, for recommender systems. </li>
        <li>Novel optimization algorithms and analysis for improving recommender systems, e.g., parallel/distributed optimization techniques and efficient stochastic gradient descent. </li>
        <li>Industrial practices and implementations of recommendation systems, e.g., feature engineering, model ensemble, and lessons from large-scale implementations of recommender systems.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
      We believe that advancements on these topics will benefit a variety of algorithm and application domains.

In MLRec2015, we had 3 contributed papers and 6 invited talks from both academia and industries. In MLRec2016, we had 4 contributed papers and 3 invited talks. There were approximate 50 attendees in each workshop, which have reached the room capacity.
