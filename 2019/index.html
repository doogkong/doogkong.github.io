            <p><b> <a href=" https://easychair.org/cfp/MLRec2018" target="blank"> CALL FOR PAPER</b></p>
		    
		    
	    <p>Following the success of the several editions of MLRec in
	      <a href="https://doogkong.github.io/2015/">2015</a>,
	      <a href="https://doogkong.github.io/2016/">2016</a>,
              <a href="https://doogkong.github.io/2017/">2017</a>, and
	      <a href="https://doogkong.github.io/2018/">2018</a>, 
	      the fifth edition of the MLRec workshop focuses on developing novel, and applying existing
	      Machine Learning (ML) and Data Mining (DM) methods to improve recommender systems.
	      This workshop also highly encourages applying ML-based recommendation
	      algorithms in novel application domains (e.g., precision medicine), deep learning for recommendation, and 
	      solving novel recommendation problems formulated from industry.   
	      
	      
	      The ultimate goal of the MLRec workshop series is to promote the advancement and implementation of
	      new, effective and efficient ML and DM techniques with high translational potential
	      for real and large-scale recommender systems,
	      and to expand the territory of ML-based recommender system research toward non-conventional
	      application areas where recommendation problems largely exist but haven't been fully
	      recognized. 
	      <br>
	      <br>

			      <b>Martin Ester</b>, Professor, Simon Fraser University <br /> 
			      <b>Title:</b> Recommendation in Social Media <br /> 
			      <b>Abstract:</b> Social media are media for social interaction, using highly accessible and
			      scalable communication techniques to create and exchange user-generated content. In
			      the social sciences, the effects of social influence, homophily or selection, and
			      transitivity have been identified as drivers of the dynamics of social networks. In the first
			      part of the talk we will present a matrix factorization approach to incorporate these
			      effects into a recommender system by regularizing the user factors with the user factors
			      of direct friends. In the second part, we will discuss how to exploit product reviews, a
			      popular type of user-generated content, to improve the accuracy of recommendations.
			      Our approach combines probabilistic matrix factorization with aspect-based opinion
			      mining, and we propose a graphical model based on latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) that
			      extracts product aspects and their ratings. Another important aspect of social media is
			      their support for user groups. In the third part of the talk, we explore the
			      recommendation of user groups. We propose measures for the different types of
			      engagement of users with groups that are more suitable than simple group
			      membership. We also introduce a temporal matrix factorization method that models the
			      dynamically changing patterns of user group engagement. The talk will conclude with
			      the discussion of interesting directions for future research. <br />

			      He has published extensively in the top conferences and journals of his field such as KDD,
			      ICDM and TKDE, and his work has been very well-cited. His most famous paper on DBSCAN received
			      more than 6600 citations, 
			      and his H-index is 47. He recently served as PC Co-Chair of SDM 2018, ACM/IEEE ASONAM 2014 and
			      ACM RecSys 2014. His current research interests include social network analysis, 
			      recommender systems, opinion mining, biological network analysis and high-throughput sequence data analysis.
